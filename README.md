This repository is a small collection of functions I have needed for tasks in
online competitive programming. This system is optimized for myself, mainly to
save time and reflect on my progress in algorithmic thinking. Yet, I would be
happy if it would be of use to you. ‚≠ê

Functions are distributed in directories according to their programming language
and to their "field" (e.g. algebra, geometry, combinatorics). Boundaries between
fields are fuzzy, thus file organisation is subject to change. Functions are in
separate files, which are identically named, following the specific language
convention. The only exceptions are different approaches to the same end goal
(e.g. the iterative and recursive approaches of getting Fibonacci members).
